    long ago, the 4 trigonometric functions lived together in harmony, then everything changed when the sinus function
    attacked.
    <br>
    Only the math teacher, Master of all 4 trigonometric functions could stop it, but when the trigonometric circle
    needed her most, she vanished
    <br>
    100 years passed and my brother and I discovered the new teacher
    <br>
    a math teacher named Liora
    <br>
    and although her math skills are great, she has a lot to learn before she can teach anyone.
    <br>
    but I believe Liora can save the trigonometric circle.
